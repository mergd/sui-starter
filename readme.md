### Sui Move Package Starter

Build the contracts with `sui move build`

To check that you have Sui installed on your CLI, run `sui --version`, and if you don't install it check [here](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) for instructions to install.

To deploy the contracts run `sui client` first

If you're using vscode, install `damirka.move-syntax`, `move.move-analyzer` extensions for syntax highlighting and other QoL features for Move.
